# CaCIA Trial – Cost-Effectiveness Dataset

This repository hosts the anonymized dataset from the **CaCIA randomized controlled trial (NCT03108586)**, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of two diagnostic strategies for managing posterior dental restorations over a 71-month follow-up.

## Files Included
- **Patient Costs - Updated.xlsx**  
  Patient-level costs, including total, direct, and indirect expenses.

- **Teeth Costs - Updated.xlsx**  
  Tooth-level outcomes and costs (initial interventions, failures, follow-up treatments).

- **Indirect Costs CaCIA - Updated.xlsx**  
  Breakdown of opportunity costs (travel, time, wages) associated with treatment.

## Study Context
- **Groups compared:**
  - *C group (CARS criteria)* – diagnosis based only on secondary caries.  
  - *C+AS group (FDI criteria)* – broader diagnosis including marginal adaptation and staining.  
- **Outcomes:** new operative interventions, treatment costs (PPP-adjusted International Dollars).  
- **Analyses:** ICER, net monetary benefit (NMB), bootstrap uncertainty.
